## Evaluation of victim and perpetrator models

The PBPK models of **midazolam**, **itraconazole**, and **rifampicin** were developed with clinical data covering a broad dosing range possible for intravenous as well as oral, single and multiple dose administration of all drugs. Plasma or serum concentrations, fractions excreted to urine or bile, and other clinical measurements were included for model development whenever available. 

For further references please refer to the database for observed data [[1](#reference)] and respective model repositories [[2-4](#reference)].
